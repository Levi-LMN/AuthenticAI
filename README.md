# AuthenticAI

## Overview
AuthenticAI is an advanced AI-powered system designed to detect fraudulent bank statements with high accuracy. By leveraging machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing (NLP), AuthenticAI analyzes subtle document details such as fonts, formatting, transaction patterns, and security features to distinguish genuine bank statements from forgeries.

## Features
- **AI-Powered Fraud Detection** – Detects manipulated bank statements using deep learning models.
- **Text & Formatting Analysis** – Examines font type, size, character spacing, and alignment for inconsistencies.
- **Bank-Specific Verification** – Identifies authentic logos, watermarks, and document structures.
- **Transaction Pattern Analysis** – Flags irregularities in transaction history, timestamps, and balance calculations.
- **Metadata & Digital Fingerprint Examination** – Detects tampering through hidden metadata analysis.
- **Automated & Scalable** – Provides fast and scalable document verification for banks, embassies, and financial institutions.

## Use Cases
- **Visa & Immigration Processing** – Ensures submitted financial statements are authentic.
- **Loan & Credit Approvals** – Helps banks verify customer financial history.
- **Property Rentals & Leases** – Protects landlords from fake income proofs.
- **Employment Background Checks** – Confirms the validity of salary slips and bank statements.
- **Fraud Prevention for Businesses** – Ensures authenticity in financial transactions.

## How It Works
1. **Upload Document** – Users upload a scanned or digital bank statement.
2. **AI Analysis** – The system scans and analyzes text, formatting, and transaction details.
3. **Authenticity Score** – AuthenticAI provides a confidence score indicating the likelihood of fraud.
4. **Verification Report** – A detailed report highlights detected inconsistencies and risk factors.
